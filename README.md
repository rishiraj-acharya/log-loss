# log-loss
<br>The interactive visualization in the browser lets you try to find the logistic curve that minimizes log-loss for a randomized set of data points with one feature:
<br>• The slider on the left controls b_1 (coefficient of feature 1)
<br>• The slider on the right controls b_0 (intercept)
<br>You can see the log-loss on the right side of the visualization.
